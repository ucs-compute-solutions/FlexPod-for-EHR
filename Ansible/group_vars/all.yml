# This is the top-level variable file that will be used for the FlexPod setup. It is setup in this case to have Fibre Channel SAN boot with
# FC-NVMe and NFS storage protocols. Notice that the configure_iscsi variable is commented out, meaning iSCSI boot will not be configured.
# iSCSI variable parameters are left in for guidance and commented out where necessary. If iSCSI boot is configured, uncomment all iSCSI variables.
